Welcome to ECCO version 4's documentation!
==========================================

Here, you will learn about simple methods that allow you to download, analyze, rerun, or modify ECCO and MITgcm solutions. Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, version 4, release 2 (`ECCO v4 r2`) is used as a representative example before documenting newer solutions and additional resources associated with the MIT general circulation model (`MITgcm`).
