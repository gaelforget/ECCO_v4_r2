Welcome to ECCO version 4's documentation!
==========================================

Here, you will learn about simple methods that are available to download, analyze, rerun, or modify ECCO and MITgcm solutions. In :ref:`downloads` and :ref:`runs`, the `ECCO v4 r2` solution is used as a representative example before reviewing other solutions and additional resources associated with the MIT general circulation model (`MITgcm`). For an overview of the ECCO version 4 framework, please refer to :cite:`for-eta:15`.
