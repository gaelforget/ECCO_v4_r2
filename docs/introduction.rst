Introduction
************

ECCO v4 r2 is an ocean state estimate that covers the period from 1992 to 2011
:cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`. It is a minor update of the original
ECCO v4 r1 solution :cite:`for-eta:15` that benefits from a
few additional corrections listed in
:cite:`dspace-eccov4r2`, is provided with
additional model-data misfit and model budget output, and has become easier to
rerun than ECCO v4 r1. 


The :ref:`downloads` section provides an installation guide and
links to various analysis tools. The :ref:`runs` section provides simple
instructions to rerun model solutions, which can be useful to generate 
additional output for example, and start experimenting with the model.
